How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The diff functionality makes it easier to see changes to specific lines identifying changes and possible issues.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    The history of a file makes it easier to identify bug, expand on the functionality, and roll back to any previous revisions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automatic saves often save too frequently preventing each version from being meaningful.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The differences are functionality where as Google Docs is more for recovering files, Git is used for versioning and development. Often it makes sense to commit changes to several files at once as there can be dependencies.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log will show you all the commits. Git diff will allot you to see the differences between two revisions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Version control makes it easy to go back to any point in time or remove any changes made, so if a break occurs it is easy to recover from.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    EVERYTHING!!!
